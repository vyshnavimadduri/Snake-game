The Snake game is implemented using Python's pygame library, which handles graphics and game logic. The snake moves continuously in a grid-based environment and grows in length when it eats food. Collision with the game boundaries or the snake's own body ends the game. Keyboard inputs control the snake's direction, and the game speed increases as the snake grows. The code is structured using loops and conditionals to manage game state, rendering, and interactions.
